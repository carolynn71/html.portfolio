<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Tashifa Nooreen, a dedicated and passionate student currently pursuing two degrees: a B.Tech in Computer
  Science Engineering (AI and ML) from Vardhaman College of Engineering and a BS in Data Science from IIT Madras,
  both set to complete in 2027. My academic journey began at Heritage Valley, The Indian School, where I built a strong
  foundation, followed by my 11th and 12th studies at Excellencia Junior College. With a CGPA of 9.2 in my first semester
  and a gold star in Python programming on HackerRank, I am committed to excellence in my field.</p>

<p>My enthusiasm for programming and technology drives me to constantly seek new challenges and opportunities. I am particularly
  interested in AI and ML and aim to explore a wide range of projects in these areas. My long-term goal is to apply my AI
  and ML expertise to human physiology-related projects, but I am open to exploring various fields to broaden my
  knowledge and skills. I am actively looking for opportunities to participate in competitive programming and tech events
  to further enhance my abilities</p>

<p>I am eager to connect and collaborate with like-minded individuals and professionals in
  the tech community. If you share my passion for AI, ML, or programming, I would love to connect and explore potential
  collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at tashifanooreen@gmail.com . Letâ€™s innovate and create impactful
  solutions together!</p>
